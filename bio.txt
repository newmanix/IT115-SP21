Jason Rivas,
Mostly a self-taught Software Developer with 1,500+ dedicated hours learning software development. I first started learning coding through creating web-applications at the Coding Dojo. There, I learned the fundamentals of programming by creating full-stack applications. For the past three years, I have been working with different computer languages, frameworks, databases, and servers. I have also done deeper research in using different pieces of software and technologies such as: AI programming (dwelling into the theory of neural networks), Unity3D (creating game assets, writing and applying scripts, utilizing the physics engine) & android app development with Android Studio.

I have no experience working in a professional software setting for a successful company, but I do have one professional example to show: a couple of months after I completed my education at Coding Dojo and there, our focused learning objective was on backend development and spent only very little time on learning frontend development; I landed a freelance gig to design a static webpage. I could create a full-stack application, but I couldn't create a modern looking design. My client was completely unsatisfied with what I was able to produce. Thinking I was confident in this field, identifying my weaknesses humbled me. Therefore I searched online for best mordern techniques to create beautfiul wesbsites.

What makes me unique is my extensive demonstratable knowledge in the software field. I have developed the skill to face bugs during development, ask questions and get answers. Learning how to read through documentation is important for developers to know, and it was intimidateing at first to learn. I now offer people the chance to learn web-development. I have had the chance to teach kids K-5 coding concepts such as variables, functions, syntax, vocabulary, etc. I even teach people my age and people older than me.
